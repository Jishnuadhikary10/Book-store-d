## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Ensure your system has the **npm** package manager installed with version >= 9.8.0.

### 2. Dependencies Setup

1. Open a terminal and navigate to both the `frontend` and `backend` directories of the project.
2. In each directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
Each directory contains a package.json file that defines the project's metadata and dependencies. The npm install command ensures all required packages are installed.

3. Running the Application
To start the application, follow these steps:

Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend directory, then run the following command to start the frontend service:

bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will start the frontend service on port 5173.

Next, navigate to the backend directory and run the following command to start the backend service:

bash
Copy code
npm run start
This will start the backend service on port 5500.

Once both services are running, open your browser and navigate to:

http://localhost:5173/ or
http://127.0.0.1:5173/
4. Terminating the Services
To stop the services:

In the terminal windows where the frontend and backend services are running, press CTRL + C to stop the servers.
Repeat this process in both the frontend and backend directories.
